# The Pefect Pokemon List (Pokemon Go)

This is a simple bit of JS and CSS that generates a list of the stats you get if
a Pokemon has perfect IV's.

Select a pokemon from the top drop down box and it gives you a list for each level
of that pokemon.

I wrote this cause I wanted a quick way to eliminate pokemon from my bag. The IV
calculators are nice, but they're just too slow to use. This gives you a list
you can easily compare to the pokemon in your bag.

Enjoy!

# How to use

Grab the index.html from this repo, download it to your machine, then just open it.
Everything it needs is in the one file.

OR - just go here: https://rawgit.com/takigama/perfect_poke_list/master/index.html

# Building - not required unless your fixing something

* CLone the repo.
* edit the files in the "parts" directory
* from the root of the repo run "sh build.sh"
* index.html is regengerated

# Bugs, etc

probably millions - its not my best work, was written based on getting it done
quickly, not well.

This page also doesnt work with githubs htmlpreviewer for reason, and i cant
be bothered figuring out why - such is life.

I probably wouldn't put it online if I were you, though realistically its just
a single html file, so it shouldnt break anything really. Surfice it to say
if it does burn down your house, its not my fault.
