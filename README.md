# The Pefect Pokemon List (Pokemon Go)

This is a simple bit of JS and CSS that generates a list of the stats you get if
a Pokemon has perfect IV's.

Select a pokemon from the top drop down box and it gives you a list for each level
of that pokemon.

I wrote this cause I wanted a quick way to eliminate pokemon from my bag. The IV
calculators are nice, but they're just too slow to use. This gives you a list
you can easily compare to the pokemon in your bag.

Enjoy!
